# EEE3088F_Project
 
The project will be a Self-Contained Light Sensing Module.
This will include an ambient light digital sensor and an analog voltage divider using photoresistors (Amount dependant on budget).
The module will include EEEPROM and battery power.
The prupose of the Git is for the programming of the microcontroller to FTDI-USB converter, EEPROM read and write, Reading from the sensors using I2C and the on-board ADC of the microcintroller.

NOTE - Additionally a low power standby mode may be added

Proposed branches 
- Sensors
